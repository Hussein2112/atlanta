A

9-
A Linux administrator must identify a user with high disk usage.
The administrator runs the # du s /home/* command and gets the following output:
43   /home/User1
2701 /home/User2
133089 /home/User3
3611 /home/User4

D.	find . name /home/User3 -print








1- What is an inode and how do you indentify the inode of a file?
 Inodes are Objects that store metadata about files and directories on a file system.
 Metadata: Time values, permissions/ownership, block storage locations, etc.
 In order to identify the inode of a file, run the command "ls -li filename" 
 The -i option displays the inode number.


2- What is Journaling on a filesystem?
   Journaling is a method by which a file system records changes that have not yet been made to the file system itself in an object called a journal.



3- List the name of one virtual filesystem?
   /proc


4- List three types of partitions
    a- Primary
    b- Extended
    c- Logical


5- What is a swap space
   A swap space is a partition on the storage device that is used as RAM when the system runs out of physical memory (RAM).



6- What is the fdisk utility used for and what help on the fdisk submenu?
   fdisk is used to create, modify, and delete partitions.
   The option m will give you the list of options in the fdisk submenu


7- What is the command to update the kernel after fdisk is used to partition a disk.
   partprobe


8- Explain the following command mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb4
   Builds an xfs type filesystem on partition /dev/sdb4


9- what is the fstab filesystem used for?
   Ensures filesystems are mounted after a reboot


10-What is a logical Volume Manager and list three advantages of LVM compared to physical partition management?
   LVM is a Software that maps physical devices and partitions to logical volumes.
   Some Advantages over physical partitioning are
   - Volumes can be dynamically managed without needing a reboot
   - a Logical volume can exceed the size of any one physical device
   - You can create snapshots of logical volumes


11- Explain these commands. 
    pvcreate, vgcreate and lvcreate
   - pvcreate initializes a drive/partition as a PV
   - vgcreate creates a volume group. a VG must contain at least one PV
   - creates Logical Volumes with in a VG


12- What is a mount point?
    An access point to information stored on a local or remote storage device.


13- What is the mount command used for?
    Mount command is used for loading a parition/filesystem into a directory (mount point)
   Example: mount /dev/sdb2 /app1


14- What command will you use to list all the partitions and block storage devices in your systems?
    lsblk


15- what is the fsck command used for?
	Checks integrity of file system.  Most systems run fsck at boot.
	Errors usually caused by power/hardware failures or improper shutdown.


16- What is the tune2fs command used for:
	Configures tunable parameters on ext2/3/4 file systems.
	Tunable parameters enable you to:
	Specify number of mounts between checks.
	Specify time interval between checks.
	And more.
	You can also use tune2fs to add a journal to ext2/3 file systems.

17- List 4 xfs tools (commands)
	xfs_info   ===> Display details about filesystem 
	xfs_admin  ===> Change parameters of filesysem
	xfs_growfs ===> Expand filesystem to fill drive size
	xfs_copy   ===> copy contents of file system to another location

18- What is the CPU schedular ideal for devices that do their own sorting (USB,SSD drives)
    noop
    also, read about the "deadline" and "cfq" schedulers


19- Explain the command "iostat -d /dev/sda 3"
    Generate I/O stats for device /dev/sda once every three seconds


20-What is the command "repquota -a" used for?
	You can view how storage is being used by each user.
	Can help you troubleshoot quota issues.
	Details:
	Name of user/group.
	Total blocks being used.
	Soft limit on storage.
	Hard limit on storage.
	Grace period.
	Total inodes being used.
	Soft limit on inodes.
