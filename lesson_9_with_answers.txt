1- What is a device driver?
	Drivers are an interface between OS and device.
	Crucial for devices to function in Linux.
	Great strides have been made to write Linux-compatible drivers.
	May still be compatibility issues in certain cases.
	No matter the device, make sure:
	Device drivers are available.
	Your system has those drivers.
	Without drivers, the device may function poorly or not at all.



        Here is a link on how to display device drivers in Linux

2- How would Linux register/display a USB storage device attached to the system?
   Linux registers USB storage devices attached to the system in the 
   format /dev/sd#
   in the same way as the SCSI/SATA naming convention



3- How would you define a Thin Client
   Lightweight computing devices that connect to more 
   powerful servers for doing work.



4- T or F USB is very effective for streaming video/audio output in real-time
   False
   When you connect a video/audio peripheral to a system running any OS, 
   including Linux, you need to be mindful of the connection types it 
   uses and what types are available on the system. 
   Microphones and webcams commonly use USB, whereas USB is much less effective 
   for streaming video/audio output in real-time. Monitors, 
   for example, are more likely to use interfaces like HDMI and Display Port 
   that can carry both video and audio signals with a high degree of real-time 
   performance. 
   Some monitors may use older interfaces like DVI and VGA that only carry video.


5- List two ways you can connect to a Printer
   A- USB for physical connection.
   B- Wi-Fi and/or Ethernet adapter for network connection.
      Popular in offices; multiple clients connect to same printer.


6- Can a Linux system have more than one Network Interface?
   Yes. A system can have more than one adapter; this is especially common in 
   servers and security systems like firewalls. 
   In addition, each type of network connection protocol requires 
   its own type of adapter. 


7- Are SATA Storage devices suitable for Enterprise Production Environments?
   No. SATA Storage devices are mainly used for backups.
   Extra:
   Serial AT Attachment (SATA) is a computer bus interface standard for 
   attaching storage devices to traditional computers. In modern PCs, 
   SATA has largely replaced earlier standards like Parallel ATA (PATA) 
   and Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) as one of the dominant 
   standards in storage connection technology.
   In the past, SATA was seen as a good solution for situations where capacity 
   and cost were paramount. SATA supports multiple-terabyte drives and is 
   relatively cheap to manufacture. However, its slower data transfer rate 
   compared to alternative standards (6 gigabits per second) made it less 
   suitable for enterprise environments, and it was most commonly used for 
   backup purposes and in consumer storage. The most current revision of SATA 
   (revision 3.2) combines SATA with another bus technology called PCI Express, 
   which allows it to supports a raw data rate of up to 16 Gb/sfinally rivaling 
   its competitors.




8- Mention one difference between SCSI and SATA
   SATA is primarily used for attaching storage devices, 
   SCSI can be used to attach other types of devices as well, such as DVD-ROM 
   drives, printers, scanners, etc.
   However, its application in storage is much more common.
 
   Traditionally, SCSI uses a parallel interface, which tends to cost more 
   to manufacturer than a serial interface. However, in the past, SCSI provided 
   high transfer rates and therefore became popular in enterprise storage 
   arrays where speed was important. The Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) standard 
   was developed to apply a serial interface to SCSI technology. 
   SAS offers greater speeds than traditional SCSIup to 24 Gb/s in the recent 
   SAS-4and supports higher-capacity drives. The serial interface also supports 
   a more reliable data transfer rate. 
  SAS has become the go-to technology for many enterprise storage environments



9- What is an HBA?
  A host bus adapter (HBA) is a hardware component that connects a host system 
  to a storage device, like in a storage area network (SAN), in order to 
  facilitate the input and output of data. They are to storage devices what 
  network adapters are to networks.
  HBAs are commonly used with interface technologies like SATA and SCSI. 
  The HBA might be built into the motherboard, or it might be a separate 
  expansion card that attaches to the motherboard. In either case, you connect 
  a storage device to an HBA with the requisite interface in order for the system
  to work with that storage device



10- What is PCI?
    Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a connection interface standard 
    that is primarily used as an expansion bus for attaching peripheral devices.
	Superseded by PCIe.
	Greater transfer speeds.
	More reliable error detection.
	Smaller size.
	Dominant expansion bus technology.
	PCIe used for video cards, expansion cards, etc.
	PCIe also used for connecting NVMe SSDs.
	Even faster than SSDs in SATA/SAS.
	Will become more prominent in enterprise storage.



11- In which directories are device files located?
    A- /proc/
    B- /sys/
    C- /dev/

/proc/	Contains various files that represent system information reported 
by the kernel. In particular, the /proc/devices file contains a list of all 
device drivers that the kernel is currently running, separated by character 
and block storage devices.

/sys/	A virtual file system similar to /proc/ but that focuses more on 
creating a hierarchical view of device information. In particular, 
the /sys/devices/ subdirectory includes files that expose details about 
specific devices.

/dev/	Contains device driver files that enable the system and users 
to access devices themselves. For example, you can mount a block storage 
device by referencing it from /dev/, like /dev/sda1.
Likewise, /dev/mapper/ contains logical volumes, encrypted volumes, and other 
devices that are managed by device mapper.




12- What is udev and what does it do?
udev is a device manager that automatically detects and configures 
hardware devices.
	it is a  function of systemd.
	it is  Initialized during boot.
	it handles configuration for both hotpluggable/coldpluggable devices.
	it Loads coldpluggable modules when system is booted.
	it Loads hotpluggable modules dynamically during runtime.


13- In Which directory are the udev Rules configured?
The /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory is used to configure rules 
for how udev functions

ADDITIONAL udev RULES DIRECTORIES
=================================
There are actually several directories that are used to configure udev rules.
The /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory mentioned previously is primarily used 
for local  administration of udev. An administrator applies their own 
customizations to this directory so that udev behaves in accordance with the 
administrator's preferences and/or the organization's business needs. 
As a result, the files in this directory are loaded with the highest priority.
The /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/ directory also contains udev rules. However, 
these rules are generated by the system, and you should refrain 
from editing them. Rules in this directory are low priority, 
so a custom rule named 60- keyboard.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ will supersede 
the default 60- keyboard.rules file in the /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/ path.
Rules files can also be placed in the /run/udev/rules.d/ directory. 
These also take precedence over the system rules path. 
Rules in this path are volatile, meaning that they will apply at runtime but 
will be lost in the event of a system reboot. 
Volatile rules can be useful when you need to temporarily override a system 
rule without actually making the change persist.


14- What is the command that is used to manage udev?
    udevadm
    udevadm takes subcommands. Some are explained below
   info:    Retrieve device info/attributes stored in udev database or /sys/
   control: Modify running state of udev.
   trigger: Execute rules that apply to plugged-in devices.
   monitor: Watch for events sent by kernel or udev rule.
   test:    Simulate udev event running for a device.



15- Explain the command "udevadm info /dev/sda"
    Gives detailed info about the disk /dev/sda.



16- What is CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System)?
    CUPS is a print management system for Linux that enables a computer to 
    function as a print server. A system running CUPS is a host that can 
    initiate print jobs from client systems. These jobs are then processed 
    and sent to the appropriate printer. The main advantage of CUPS is that 
    it can process different data formats on the same print server.



17- Explain the following printer commands.
    A- lpstat -p                ===> list all the available printers to your machine and their status
    B- cupsdisable  tty2printer  ==> disable the printer tty2printer  
    C- lpstat -p | grep disabled | awk '{print $2}' | xargs cupsenable  ==> Enable all print queues



18- What is the difference between lsusb and lspci?
	The lsusb command is used to display information about devices that 
	are connected to the system's USB buses.     
	The lspci command is used to display information about devices 
	that are connected to the system's PCI buses.


19- Explain the following commands
  a-  lpq  ==> The lpq command shows the status of the printer queue. 
  b-  lsblk ==> Identifies block storage devices
  c-  lpr /etc/passwd  ==> will print /etc/passwd through the default printer
  d-  dmesg ==> Used to monitor device drivers and the underlying hardware 
              they control 
  e-  mcelog ==> Displays issues about physical RAM
  d-  free -m ==> used to display memory leaking issues. good to use with top
  f- abrt-cli ls  ==> List report problems if any
  g- lshw -c network ==> list hardware details of class network.
  Note:
     To see a list of classes currently in use on your system, 
     enter lshw -short | sort -k2 to generate a non-detailed list of devices, 
     sorted by the class column.

20- What command will you use if new LUNs (disks) are added to your machine thru 
    SAN?
   echo "- - -" /sys/class/scsi_host/host?/scan
   The alternative is a reboot.
   The hyphens in the echo statement are wildcards for SCSI controller, 
   SCSI channel, and logical unit number (LUN), respectively. 


21- How do you find if the device driver module of your ethernet adapter is loaded
    follow the steps below
    a- find out your adapter name ex: run command ip a
    b- ethtool -i enp0s3 --> will display driver (assuming your device name is enp0s3)
    c- lsmod | grep e1000
