1- What does localization usually include?
a- Translating interface into a language.
b- Converting measurements between regional systems.
c- Configuring keyboard layout.
d- Setting date and time.


2-List Three ways that you can change a system's time zone?
  a- create a symbolic link to zone file to /etc/localtime file.
     ex: Command below will set server time Central US
       ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Central  /etc/localtime
  b-   locatectl set-timezone America/New_York # This command changes server time to New York 
  c-   export TZ=America/New_York


3- Explain the following commands
  a- timedatectl set-time 23:00        ===> sets the system time to 23:00
  b- timedatectl set-ntp 0             ===> will disable NTP server synchronization
  c- date +'%Y/%m/%d %H:%M'            ===> will display the date in Year/Month/DayofMonth  Hour:Minute
  d- hwclock -w                        ===> Sync the hardware clock with the software clock.
 


4- Explain the following commands:
   a-localectl set-keymap us                  ====> Change your keyboard mapping to US
   b- localectl set-locale LANG=uk_UA.utf8    ====> Changes the Language to Ukranian


5-  What are the names of the two most common Display Servers
    X windows
    Wayland

6- What is the main difference between X Windows and Wayland display servers
   The primary difference between Wayland and X is that, in Wayland, the compositor is
   the server rather than a separate component. This enables clients to exchange events
   directly with the compositor, cutting out the X server as a middle man.


7- What is the most common Desktop Environment used today?
   GNOME


8- List Four Desktop Environments in Linux?
   GNOME
   KDE PLasma
   Cinnamon
   MATE


9- What is one benefit of using a Remote Desktop Environment over a normal ssh CLI session?
   Remote Desktop Environment is useful if you want to install a GUI application on a Remote machine
   Examples of Remote Desktop Softwares are : VNC, xrdp, NX, SPICE


10- What are services?
	Service are Software that responds to request from other programs.
	Provides specialized functionality.
	Can be critical or non-critical.
	Typically implemented as daemons.
	Daemon: Programs that run in the background.
	No user intervention necessary.
	Lie dormant until triggered.
	Can operate at regular intervals.
	Can be started by system, apps, or users.


11- What are the two main methods that initialize a Linux System?
    SysVinit
    systemd


12- Which the newer method of initializing a Linux System?
    systemd is the newer suite of software that replaced the older init method
	systemd also provides tools for service management.
	Dominant in modern Linux distros.
	Example improvements:
	Supports parallelization.
	Reduces shell overhead.
	Control Groups are better at isolating/categorizing processes.



13- What are unit files?
    Unit files are basically configuration files systemd uses to determine how to handle units.
	Units are system resources systemd can manage.
	Network services, devices, file systems, etc.
	Daemons manage resources.
	Defined in categories.
	Extension determines category (e.g., .automount).
	Written in declarative language.
	Can exist in multiple locations.
	Default is /lib/systemd/system
	Replace files in /etc/systemd/system
	Create .d directory with unit file's name and .conf file in that directory for granular editing.



14-  What are systemd targets?
     Systemd targets are basically a grouping of unit files
       example: /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target



15- What command do we use to stop, start or check the status of a service
    the systemctl command is used to control the systemd init daemon
    example:  systemctl restart sshd


16- Explain the following commands.
    systemctl isolate muti-user.target  ===> administrator perhaps wants to work in CLI mode only
    systemctl isolate graphical.target  ===> administrator perhaps wants to go back to GUI mode



17- What are 5 different states of Processes?
	Running
	Interruptible sleep
	Uninterruptible sleep
	Zombie
	Stopped 


18- Using the ps coommand, how would you list the top 10 CPU consuming processes?
    ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu |head   ===> Top ten CPU consuming processes
    ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem |head   ===> Top ten memory consuming processes


19- What is the systemd-analyze command used for?
     systemd-analyze is used to retrieve performance statistics for boot operations
     Example: systemd-analyze blame will identify services and other units the make the system slow to boot



20- Explain the following command
    a- lsof -i            ===> List all Listening and Established network services 
    b- kill -9 1234       ===> would kill PID 1234 immediately...Last resort
    c- bg %1              ===> will put the Job id 1 in the background
    d- uptime             ===> Displays stats of system and how long the system was up..Load average etc...


21- What is the significance of the following two files
    a- /proc/cpuinfo    ===> Contains info about system's processor.
    b- /proc/meminfo    ===> Contains info about system's memory.




 22- How do you find a process's nice value with the ps command
 ps -eo pid,user,args,nice --sort user|less 

23- A user wants to start the application loadtest.bin in a way that minimizes its effects on other system users. 
Which of the following commands should be used to start the application with minimal impact?
a.	nice -n 15 loadtest.bin       (correct answer is A)
b.	nohup loadtest.bin
c.	bash -x loadtest.bin
d.	sudo renice -n 15 loadtest.bin
