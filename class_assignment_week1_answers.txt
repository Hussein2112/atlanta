   touch file{1..5}        ===> It should work this time

8- Exit as mark and switch to susan
   exit
   su - susan

  touch file{6..10}
10- Who are the owners and groups of the files you just created.
    The groups owners of these files would be susan and mark which is not what we want.
    We want the group to become mkt soon as we create the files

    Make the necessary change to achieve that goal. Must make the change as root
    as root
    chmod 2775 /shared  or chmod g+s /shared

    What is the group ownership of the two newfiles now.
    Answer:
          The groups on the files now are mkt because of th SGID on the directory /shared
