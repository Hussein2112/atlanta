1- What happens if a system's / partition (aka root partition) fills up.
   A full root filesystem will crash the system.

2- Why is it a good idea to create seperate partitions for home and log directories
   Those two directories fill up quickly, so if they are not seperated can fill up 
   the / fileystem and that will cause the system to crash


3- What is a swap partition?
   it is a space in your hard drive that is treated as part of memory
   The swap space acts as an overflow area to hold additional data.
   The computer transfers data back to its RAM when it's being used and
   moves data to its page file or swap partition when it is NOT being used.


4- When purchasing a Server, List three of the server components that you must consider?
   A- CPU:
        Example:
               How many cores?
               Clock rate
               hyper-threading
               cache size
   B- Memory:
       Example:
              How much memory
              Enough DIMM Slots (in case you need to increase down the road)
              
  C- Storage:
       Example:
              How many drives & their capacity?
              What interface controller?
              Read/Write speeds?


             
5-  List the installation methods for an Operating System. How many different ways can an OS be installed?
    -Boot from DVD/USB
    -Boot from Media on Local Drive
    -Boot from network

6- On larger networks, installing Linux manually each time is not efficient. How do larger organizations install Linux, if not manually?
   They use an automated orchestration suite that distributes a pre-configured system image to the hardware
