1- List the system components that rely on the Kernel.
   -File System acces
   -Memory
   -Processes
   -Devices
   -Resource allocation



2- What is a device driver?
   A device driver is a software program that enables a computer's operating system to
interact with a hardware device, communicate with it,
and control its operations.


3- Is the Linux Kernel Monolithic or Micro Kernel? and mention one characteristic of a Monolithic Kernel
   The linux kernel is Monolithic.
   In a monolithic kernel, all system modules, such as device drivers or file systems, run in kernel space.



4- What command will you run to display the linux kernel version?
   uname -r


5- List 5 functions performed by the Kernel
   - System Call Interface (SCI)
   - Process Management
   - Memory Management
   - Fileystem Management
   - Device Management


6- what are the advantages of the Kernel modules?
	-They reduce the burden on the kernel because otherwise all of the modules'
	 functionality would have to be added directly to the kernel.
	-Dynamic loading of kernel modules facilitates lower memory consumption.
	-They avoid having to rebuild and reboot the system when new functionality is
	required 


7-  What is the directory the Kernel modules are located for Red Hat based?
    /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/"
   for example the bluetooth kernel modules would be in "/usr/lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/drivers/bluetooth/"
    /lib is a symbolic link to /usr/lib


8- Why is the modprobe command preferred over the other Kernel Module Management commmands insmod and rmmod?
	The modprobe command is capable of loading all the dependent modules before inserting the
	specified module. It is therefore preferred over using the insmod and rmmod
	commands.


9- How does the depmod command facilitate the modprobe command?
   The depmod command builds/updates the dependencies database (modules.dep) file which modprobe requires in order 
   to identify how modules are linked to one another


10- In which directory are the kernel module configuration files located?
    /etc/modprobe.d contains various .conf files 
   /etc/modprobe.conf is no longer used in newer distros


11- What is the command used to change kernel parameters? Also, list the configurable kernel parameters
    The command to change the kernel parameters is sysctl.
    The following are the parameters (which are subdirectories /proc/sys) that can be changed by the kernel
Directory          				Includes Parameters Related To
=========          				===========================
crypto              				Encryption and other cryptographic services.
debug               				Debugging the kernel.
dev                 				Specific hardware devices.
fs 						File system data.
kernel 						Miscellaneous kernel functionality.
net 						Networking functionality.
user 						User space limitations.
vm 						Virtual memory management.


12- How do you find details about your cpu and memory using the Virtual Filesystem /proc
    cat /proc/cpuinfo
    cat /proc/meminfo
Extra Note:
The /proc/ directory is a virtual file system (VFS) that provides significant
information about the kernel's running process. Some of the files in the /proc/
directory are listed in the following table.

File 				Contains
=============			===========
/proc/cmdline 			Options passed to the kernel by the boot loader at boot
				time, such as mounting the kernel as read-only.
/proc/cpuinfo 			CPU information, such as its architecture, name, clock
				speed, cache size, and more.
/proc/devices 			A list of character and block device drivers loaded into
				the currently running kernel.
/proc/filesystems 		A list of file systems types that are supported by the
				kernel, as well as if any are currently mounted.
/proc/meminfo 			Information about RAM usage, including total memory,
				free memory, and much more.
/proc/modules 			Information about modules currently installed on the
				system. An alternative to the lsmod command.
/proc/stat 			Various statistics about the system since it was last
				rebooted.
/proc/version			specifies several points of information about the Linux
kernel:
 The version of the Linux kernel currently running.
 The version of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) used to compile the kernel.
 The user name of the kernel compiler.
 The time the kernel was compiled.
The version of the kernel may impact system functionality, so you can use this file to
validate that version.	



13- What command do you run to look for potential issues with your hadware or kernel components
    dmesg (-H option makes more human readable)

14- explain the following commands
   a- #dmesg -h               ====> help for dmesg command...by the way similar info can be found in /var/log/messages
   b- #dmesg -H -l err        ====> Search the kernel buffer for priority error  messages
   c- #dmesg -H |grep usb     ====> Search the kernel buffer for usb related info
   d- modinfo usblp           ====> Get information about the usb printer device driver

15- Following the Example below  load the btrfs kernel module
    then blacklist it so it does NOT load after a kernel reboot
 First, let us ensure the module gets loaded after a reboot, so we  must create
a configuration in /etc/modules-load.d/*.conf or /run/modules-load.d/*.conf or
/usr/lib/modules-load.d/*.conf
  Example:  vi /etc/modules-load.d/btrfs.conf
# Load btrfs.ko at boot
  btrfs

#Save the file then reboot.

If you want to blacklist a module, then follow the list below for example.
