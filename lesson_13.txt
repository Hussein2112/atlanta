19- Create the following text in a script and name it case.sh
    Execute the script and see if you can understand what it is doing.
#-------------------------------------------------------------   
#!/bin/bash
    var=blue
case $var in
red)
echo "Your color is red."
;;
green)
echo "Your color is green."
;;
blue)

var=("Carla" "Robert" "Mary")

for i in ${var[*]}
